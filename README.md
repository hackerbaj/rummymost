# Fusion4 – Mental Health App

## 📌 Introduction
India is facing a growing mental health crisis. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), more than **1.6 lakh people died by suicide in 2022**, with students forming a large percentage. Stress, academic pressure, lack of awareness, and limited access to mental health professionals are key challenges.  

Our team **Fusion4 (Umar, Ranjini, Prithya, Vedank)** aims to address this through a **Mental Health App** that leverages technology to provide accessible, real-time, and stigma-free support.
